On the day of transfer , the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium ; thus , a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants . While in the PACU , Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89% . The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume . He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully . He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement . No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia , although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction . Therefore , he was admitted for C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion . Interoperatively , he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate , although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively . Mr. Robert Mackey is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus . He was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day . He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume . His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask . Mr.  Mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy ; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6 , less so at C4-C5 , with clear cut cord compression , particularly on the right side C5-C6 .
